* M.S. in Jekyll, Github University, 2014
* Ph.D in Version Control Theory, Github University, 2018 (expected)

Work experience
======
* 2016-2018: [uBiome](https://www.ubiome.com) - Group leader of Statistical Genetic.
  *  Responsible for statistical data analyses and analytical innovations for lead identification for new products. Directly responsible for results and analyses resulting on over 45 provisional and 5 regular patent applications to the USPTO.
  
* 2014-2016: Research Associate at Center for Systems Biotechnology of the [Fraunhofer Foundation in Chile](https://www.fraunhofer.cl/) - Group leader.
  * I designed, planned and and executed research and development programs and projects on plant and animal breeding, human genetics and bioinformatics for industry and academic partners.
  
* 2014-2015: [FONDEF](https://www.conicyt.cl/fondef/)
  * Reviewer for the “Human Health” committee of FONDEF program of CONICYT.
  
* 2014-2015: Genomic Medicine Group led by [Michael Simpson's](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/gmm/departments/mmg/researchgroups/SimpsonLab/index.aspx) group at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/gmm/departments/mmg/researchgroups/SimpsonLab/index.aspx)
  * Research associate at Simpson’s group (KCL) as part of genetics of high cognitive ability project,
  aka HiQ project, also led by Dr Robert Plomin (KCL). Statistical genetics analysis of exon-chip
  data ~5000 individuals for the identification of genetic variants associated human intelligence.
  
 * 2011-2013: Social insetc's genomics with [Mark Brown](https://www.markjfbrown.com/) and [Seirian Sumner](www.sumnerlab.co.uk) 
  * Post-doctoral research assistant working with Mark (Royal Holloway University of
London)and Seirian (Bristol University). The project used RNA-seq to study the
interaction between the parasitic Sphaerularia bombi and its bumble-bee host, a model of the
extended phenotype theory.

* 2007-2011: PhD thesis with [Gerome Breen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ioc3_FMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Michael Barnes](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/drmichaelrbarnes) at King's College London.
  * I developed and implemented a bioinformatic and statistical tool for systems biology
analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Dissertation entitled: [Gene and gene-set
analysis of GWAS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4102).

* 2005-2007: [David Holmes’](https://scholar.google.cl/citations?user=2mFt-0MAAAAJ&hl=en) at  group at the Center for Bioinformatics and Comparative Genomics of the Life Science Foundation (Santiago, Chile).
  * Bioinformatics and comparative genomics of extremophiles microorganisms. 

* 2005: [Alex Bateman’s](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/alex-bateman) group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge, UK).
  * Construction of sequence families of DNA sequences using Hidden Markov Models.

* 2004: Dr. [Luis Burzio’s](http://www.cienciavida.org/luis-burzio-phd/) group at Life Science Foundation (Santiago, Chile). 
  * I did an internship on molecular biology for 3 months working on potentially new regulatory RNAs.
